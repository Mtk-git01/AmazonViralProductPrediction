# Amazon Viral Product_Prediction Model
- All Keepa product data should be stored in your folder (e.g., ./data/raw_data/*.pkl)  
- Use "keepa_advanced_data_downloader.ipynb" to download product raw data from keepa using your API key, token
## Objective
- To build a prediction model for identifying future viral Amazon products using historical product raw data extracted via the Amazon Keepa API.

## Monetary Calculation and Confusion Matrix
- Since amazon doesn't show actual sales unit, used a formula from prior research to estimate Weekly sales unit based on SalesRank  
*Since this formula works best for mid-rank products around SalesRank:1000, used detected products ranked between 500 and 1500

## Conclusion
- If we assume profit is 10% of sales, we can expect an additional $4,400 in profit per week.
## Model Usability: Baby Products
- Confirmed the modelâ€™s usability for other product categories as well, such as Baby Products.
