## Monetary Calculation and Confusion Matrix
- Since amazon doesn't show actual sales unit, used a formula from prior research to estimate Weekly sales unit based on SalesRank  
*Since this formula works best for mid-rank products around SalesRank:1000, used detected products ranked between 500 and 1500
