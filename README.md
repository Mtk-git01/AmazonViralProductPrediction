# Amazon Viral Product_Prediction Model
- Data Source: Amazon Keepa, External Factors
- All Keepa product data should be stored in your folder (e.g., ./data/raw_data/*.pkl)  
- Use "keepa_advanced_data_downloader.ipynb" to download product raw data from keepa using your API key, token
## Objective
- To build a prediction model for identifying future viral Amazon products using historical product raw data extracted via the Amazon Keepa API.
- Viral Definition: SalesRank growth rate < - 30% in 30 days

## Background  

The retail and e-commerce industries struggle to adapt to rapidly changing market trends, especially with the rise of viral products. Failure to anticipate surges in demand, sales velocity, or price fluctuations can lead to missed opportunities and lost market share.
## Solution  

This project develops a predictive model to identify products with viral potential over 30-, 60-, and 90-day periods, enabling retailers to proactively adjust inventory, pricing, and marketing strategies to maximize profits.

## Monetary Calculation and Confusion Matrix
- Since amazon doesn't show actual sales unit, used a formula from prior research to estimate Weekly sales unit based on SalesRank  
*Since this formula works best for mid-rank products around SalesRank:1000, used detected products ranked between 500 and 1500

## Conclusion
- If we assume profit is 10% of sales, we can expect an additional $4,400 in profit per week.
## Model Usability: Baby Products
- Confirmed the modelâ€™s usability for other product categories as well, such as Baby Products.
